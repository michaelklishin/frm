# frm, for Frakking RabbitMQ Manager

This is `frm`, a RabbitMQ version switcher based on the [generic binary builds](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-generic-unix).

It is inspired by multiple (runtime) version management tools, from `rvm` to `kerl` to `fnm` to `rustup`.

## Intended Use Cases

`frm` was developed to be used in development and (certain) integration testing scenarios,
namely when testing client libraries against a range of RabbitMQ server versions.

## Project Maturity

`frm` is a very young project, breaking changes are likely.
